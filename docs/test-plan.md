IDENTIFICATION INFORMATION
--------------------------

### Product

- **Product Name:** SwiftEdge Security & Optimizer

### Project Description

SwiftEdge Security & Optimizer is a lightweight Windows-based software application designed to enhance computer performance and security in a single, streamlined solution. The project aims to eliminate the need for multiple optimization and security tools by integrating system cleanup, performance tuning, and enhanced cybersecurity measures into one intuitive platform. The application offers features such as junk file removal, system optimization, high-risk software version numbers comparison, and generic security checking.

### Testing Objectives

The objective of this test plan is to validate and ensure that SwiftEdge Security & Optimizer functions as intended, meets project requirements, and operates reliably under multiple system conditions. Testing will confirm performance enhancements, verify vulnerability scanning accuracy, ensure the ability to rollback changes, and evaluate usability. The goal is to identify defects early and confirm that our solution is a viable and stable product for real-world uses.

INTEGRATION TEST
----------------

### Integration Test Strategy and Extent of Integration Testing

**Purpose of Integration Testing:** Integration testing focuses on verifying that all modules for SwiftEdge operate correctly within the shared Windows Forms GUI. Although each module runs independently, integration testing ensures that system-wide components such as UAC permissions, logging, restore-point creation, and user warnings function consistently across all modules. The main goal is to confirm that all modules can be executed and run in sequence, out of order, or together without conflict. 

### Integration Test Cases

| #   | OBJECTIVE | INPUT | EXPECTED RESULTS | TEST DELIVERABLES |
| --: | --------- | ----- | ---------------- | ----------------- |
|  1  | Verify GUI & Module Integration: Ensure each tab correctly triggers the corresponding script and updates the UI & log folder. | Execute EXE -> execute one action from each tab. | GUI is stable (No Artifacts), no overlap between actions, and all actions performed correctly for each module. | Screenshots of GUI & Consolidated Log File |
|  2  | Verify Restore Point Integration | Check the box for creating a restore point before executing any module. | A restore point is created once and has no interference. Restore point does not reset or delete if UI updates. | Log showing restore point creation. |
|  3  | Consistent Logging Across All Modules | Run each module in sequence and then run each out of order. | Logs from all modules use the same timestamp format and file structure. No missing or duplicated data. | Consolidated log file & Screenshot of separated log files in folder. |
|  4  | Module Execution Stability | Run any of the modules followed by another module. | All modules must complete within a reasonable time, complete successfully, and the GUI must remain responsive throughout execution. | Timestamped log entries for each completed log & possible screenshot of utilized system resources. |
|  5  | Administrator priviledge, UAC, & GUI Feedback | Launch application or attempt any module without proper UAC level. Relaunch with elevated permissions. | Non-Admin attempted execution results in a failure, elevated run executes properly and gives correct GUI feedback. | UAC warning message screenshots, screenshot of GUI feedback. |

USER-ACCEPTANCE TEST
--------------------

Verify that the solution works for potential user. Include the method (e.g.,
heuristic, performance measures, thinking aloud, observation, questionnaire, 
interviews, etc.), the number of participants and demographics, the concent
form, *scenarios*, scripts to read, and data collection methods.

### User-Acceptance Test Strategy

User Acceptance Testing (UAT) will be conducted to verify that SwiftEdge Security & Optimizer meets end-user expectations and functions correctly in a real-world environment. The goal is to confirm that the interface is functional and aesthetically appealing to end-users, modules execute without errors, and performance and security changes behave as intended. Testing will be completed by a small group of users, including some technology-competent individuals and some typical everyday end-users. All tests will be performed on devices running Windows 11, and each participant will perform typical use case scenarios such as running optimization, cleanup, security hardening, and vulnerability scans. Feedback will be collected through immediate observation and short user surveys to evaluate usability, functionality, and overall satisfaction when using the tool.

### User-Acceptance Test Cases

| #   | TEST ITEM | EXPECTED RESULTS | ACTUAL RESULTS | DATE |
| --: | --------- | ---------------- | -------------- | ---- |
|  1  | Launch SwiftEdge Security & Optimizer & Navigate All GUI Items | GUI loads with a welcome screen prompting a system restore point. After the welcome screen, the four module tabs appear. All text is readable & application launches as intended. |                |      |
|  2  | Run Performance Optimization Module | Performance Optimization module runs as intended, changes power plans, disables services, animations, and improves system performance.  |                |      |
|  3  | Run Security Hardening Module | SMBv1 and Remote services are disabled, defender configuration applied, firewall configuration applied, and STIGs followed successfully. |                |      |
|  4  | Run System Cleanup Module | All TEMP files, Prefetch files, caches, and the recycle bin are cleared. |  |      |
|  5  | Run Vulnerability Scanner Module | Installed Application list displayed with version numbers and CVE comparisons. The export option, if checked before running, will export results to a file. |         |      |
|  6  | Check user feedback and overall usability | All feedback messages (Success, Warning, Error) are understandable. User completes all tasks without confusion. User can understand warnings from CVE results |  |      |
