## 2. Product Overview
> This section should describe the general factors that affect the product and its requirements. This section does not state specific requirements. Instead, it provides a background for those requirements, which are defined in detail in Section 3, and makes them easier to understand.

### 2.1 Product Perspective
SwiftEdge Security is a new, self-contained system developed as a standalone utility for Windows 11 environments. It is not part of an existing software family and does not serve as a direct replacement for any commercial or enterprise-level product. However, it draws conceptual inspiration from tools like Chris Titus Tech’s Windows Utility, Talon by RavenDevTeam, and Azurite Optimizer while providing a cleaner, more security-driven PowerShell-native alternative.

This product is designed to consolidate multiple commonly used administrative and security actions, such as disabling bloatware, optimizing performance settings, and checking for known software vulnerabilities inside a unified user interface. By building the software entirely in PowerShell and packaging it with PS2EXE, SwiftEdge Security eliminates the need for Python runtimes, Python wrapping with Nuitka, third-party debloaters, and manual PowerShell script execution.

**There are no direct dependencies on other systems. However, it does interface with:**
- The Windows Registry (for performance and privacy tweaks),
- The Windows Service Controller (to manage and disable services),
- The NVD API (to retrieve vulnerability data based on installed software),
- Local system components like Power Plans, Disk Cleanup, Defragmentation, and Temp File Directories.

### 2.2 Product Functions
> SwiftEdge Security provides a modular interface that enables users to perform common system maintenance, optimization, and security tasks on Windows 11 systems. Each function is encapsulated within its own script and is accessible via a centralized GUI.

**At a high level, the product must allow users to:**   

*Performance Optimization*
- Enable the High Performance or Ultimate Performance power plan. 
- Disable non-essential services such as SysMain and Windows Search.
- Disable background apps, animations, and transparency effects.
- Optimize registry settings for boot and responsiveness improvements.

*Security Hardening*
- Disable vulnerable or unnecessary services (e.g., SMBv1, Remote Assistance).
- Enable key Windows Defender features like tamper protection and memory integrity.
- Apply firewall or system-level security tweaks to reduce attack surface.
- Offer the option to create a System Restore Point before applying changes.

*System Cleanup*
- Clear system temp folders and Windows Update caches.
- Remove unused or unwanted built-in Windows applications.
- Clear Event Viewer logs and optionally disable hibernation.
- Free up storage by automating disk cleanup and emptying the recycle bin.

*Vulnerability Scanning*
- Detect installed applications and retrieve their version numbers.
- Query open-source CVE databases (e.g., NVD API) to identify known vulnerabilities.
- Display CVE results with severity scores and summaries.
- Allow export of scan results to CSV or TXT.

*User Interface and Workflow*
- Provide a tab-based GUI built in PowerShell using Windows Forms.
- Require administrative privileges for critical operations.
- Display status and result feedback within the GUI.
- Function as a standalone EXE file requiring no third-party framework installation.

### 2.3 Product Constraints

The application will run only on Windows 11 (64-bit) systems and does not support macOS or Linux environments.

**Quality of Service Constraints:**
- All actions must complete with minimal delay (under 30 seconds), particularly on low-end systems with 4GB RAM and dual-core processors.
- Vulnerability scanning requires internet access and may be limited by API rate limits or response time from external databases.

**Standards and Compliance Constraints:**
- PowerShell scripts must comply with Windows Execution Policy and may require elevated privileges (Administrator access) to perform system-level changes.
- When deployed in educational or institutional settings, the tool must not violate FERPA, PII handling guidelines, or local IT usage policies.

**Design and Implementation Constraints:**
- The application must be built using only PowerShell 5.1+ without relying on third-party frameworks such as Python, Node.js, or compiled .NET projects.
- Final distribution must be in the form of a standalone executable created with PS2EXE, requiring all features to be embedded within a single compiled script.
- Modules must remain functionally independent, avoiding shared state or dependencies across performance, security, cleanup, or scanning functions.

- The operating environment is assumed to be Windows 11 (64-bit) or later, with PowerShell 5.1+ pre-installed.
- The system will have access to the internet when using the Vulnerability Scanner module to query external APIs.
- End users are expected to have basic to moderate familiarity with system maintenance tools and GUI-based applications.
- Windows will maintain consistent registry and service names (e.g., SysMain, DiagTrack) relevant to script logic.
- The PS2EXE module used to compile the application into an .exe will remain compatible with PowerShell 5.1 and Windows Forms functionality.

**Dependencies:**
- NVD API is used to retrieve CVE information for the Vulnerability Scanner module. This dependency includes:
- Continued availability and free access to the API.
- Stability of response formats (JSON).
- The application relies on several native Windows tools and services, including:
- powercfg, Get-Service, Stop-Service, Get-ItemProperty, and cleanmgr.
- All external scripts and modules (e.g., PS2EXE) must be downloadable and usable within the project’s timeframe.
- No commercial libraries, SDKs, or paid APIs are required or integrated into the system.

*These assumptions and dependencies form the basis for requirement decisions and software behavior. If any become invalid or unsupported, adjustments in requirements, testing, or distribution methods may be necessary.*

> This section outlines how SwiftEdge Security will be structured, built, distributed, and maintained. It includes implementation constraints, portability expectations, cost, timeline, and proof-of-concept deliverables.

#### 3.5.1 Installation
> This section is specifically for understanding how this software will run. SwiftEdge Security does not require any extended installation.

* **D&I-I1:** Software should run directly as a compiled .EXE file created using PS2EXE from a carvable PowerShell script.
* **D&I-I2:** Software should not require any additional installation steps, frameworks, or runtimes unless out of date. (This may be required for the .NET framework utilized by Windows Forms GUI).
* **D&I-I3:** This tool should be compatible with systems that have PowerShell 5.1+ installed. (Installed by default on Windows 11).

#### 3.5.2 Distribution
> This section is specific to the distribution and open-source property of SwiftEdge Security.

* **D&I-D1:** Software should be distributed as a standalone executable .EXE. Script code will only be available through GitHub.
* **D&I-D2:** No internet connection should be required for operation except for the Vulnerability Scanner Module.
* **D&I-D3:** The executable may be optionally signed but not required for future use in managed environments. 

#### 3.5.3 Maintainability
> The Maintainability of SwiftEdge Security is based on code readability, updates, debugging, future enhancement, collaboration, and increased adaptability. This is why the open-source property of SwiftEdge Security makes it so great.

* **D&I-M1:** All code must follow industry formatting standards for formatting, naming, and overall structure.
* **D&I-M2:** The code should be modular, separating GUI logic from each script module.
* **D&I-M3:** Feature modules should be loosely coupled, allowing reuse or replacement with minimal disruption to the rest of the application.
* **D&I-M4:** Configuration variables should be easily editable and refined.
* **D&I-M5:** Scripts should detect and handle missing or deprecated features accordingly. (Note: However this may not apply to Windows 11 only compatibility).
* **D&I-M6:** Changelogs and version history shall be maintained within the source repository or packaging README.
* **D&I-M7:** Software should be easy to update including vulnerability databases to be ready for small changes and Windows updates
* **D&I-M8:** As Windows 11 continues to evolve, the software shall be designed to easily adapt to deprecations or changes in PowerShell cmdlets, Windows APIs, or system services.
* **D&I-M9:** The vulnerability scanning feature shall pull CVE data dynamically from the NVD API to ensure up-to-date threat detection without requiring updates to the software itself.
* **D&I-M10:** Periodic review of PowerShell commands, registry tweaks, and cleanup procedures shall be conducted to ensure compatibility with Windows Feature Updates and cumulative patches.

#### 3.5.4 Reusability
> SwiftEdge Security was designed with Reusability in mind and should thoughtfully demonstrate that throughout its implication.

* **D&I-R1:** Each functional module should be completely reusable as an independent PowerShell script.
* **D&I-R2:** Scripts should include standardized return codes and logging, enabling integration into pipelines or other systems.
* **D&I-R3:** Software used for NVD API, CVEs, or PowerShell Scripts should be isolated and maintain independent functionality.

#### 3.5.5 Portability
> Portability of SwiftEdge Security is based on a standalone .EXE this could be available on a USB, however, best cybersecurity practices should be followed and the .EXE should only be downloaded from the source repository.

* D&I-P1: The software should be portable within Windows 11 (x64) environments.
* D&I-P2: No cross-platform support offered. (No macOS or Linux Support).
* D&I-P3: Future implications of software may include a deprecated version specifically for Windows 10. (NOTE: Windows 10 no longer has Long-Term-Support LTS).

#### 3.5.6 Cost
> SwiftEdge Security believes that it should be free to keep your computer fast, secure, and optimized. Therefore SwiftEdge Security should not be under any circumstances sold or require payment.

* **D&I-C1:** All tools and libraries used should be free and open-source.
* **D&I-C2:** All tools and libraries should be readily accessible to the public.
* **D&I-C3:** The project as a whole should require no licensing, subscriptions, or commercial software unless otherwise indicated. 

#### 3.5.7 Deadline
 GUI completion 9/25/2025
 Testing 11/1/2025 - 11/30/2025
 Full project completion 01/30/2026

#### 3.5.8 Proof of Concept
> This section outlines the necessary items for SwiftEdge Security to be considered a proof of concept and must have some form of actual functionality before being distributed as a pre-release.

* **D&I-PC1:** Working Windows Forms GUI with tab-based navigation.
* **D&I-PC2:** Working Performance Module
* **D&I-PC3:** Working Cleanup Module
* **D&I-PC4:** Partially Assembled Security Module that will at the bare minimum output a security assessment.
* **D&I-PC5:** A Vulnerability Scanner that collects installed software info, retrieves information from the NVD API, and displays the results either in a text file or terminal.
* **D&I-PC6:** All functionality to-date should be wrapped in a single standalone executable .exe.
* **D&I-PC7:** Demonstration video, screenshots, or presentation on successful execution of each functioning module. 

## 4. Verification

### 5.3 BAD EXAMPLES OF SOFTWARE
> Note: that the software listed below is either suspicious or malware, the design and idea behind the project was an original inspiration to making a secure optimizer. These are bad examples of performance or security optimizers and should not be installed or followed for creating secure optimizing software.

**Azurite Optimizer (WARNING: MALWARE)** (Although it is malware it was an original inspiration for this project due to the idea/design)  
**Due to Azurite being malware or suspicious activity, I will not be including the download link.**    

**8 PC Optimizers that are wrapped as malware.** [Beware of these 8 PC tune-up tools](https://www.fortect.com/malware-damage/pc-tuneup-software-malware/?srsltid=AfmBOopUsrZr6Lp9m9m6dvqGR7q1RNxFhEN8nOjlVGoIciYyk3rwpeQG)

**Talon - RavenDevTeam**
> Note: Talon by the RavenDevTeam was considered malware by AVs and other cybersecurity professionals. However, after digging and carving out the file it became clear that the reason Talon is flagged as malware by AVs is due to the wrapper used to wrap the Python code as an executable. Talon uses Nuitka which wraps the Python code and makes it difficult for AVs and other professionals to read and understand what the program does. However, RavenDevTeam has all of the code in the GitHub repository to view and go through to understand exactly what the program does.
