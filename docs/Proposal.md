Problem Statement
-----------------

Slow computer performance and security threats are common frustrations for users. Cluttered files, outdated applications, and inadequate system protection often lead to sluggish systems and increased vulnerability. While cleaning up your system and keeping software updated can help, managing multiple tools for performance optimization and security is a hassle. \

Most users rely on separate antivirus programs and performance boosters, but these often conflict, drain system resources, or leave security gaps. This inefficiency leads to wasted time, reduced productivity, and increased vulnerability to cyberattacks, which cost individuals and businesses millions every year. \

SwiftEdge Security & Optimizer solves this by combining system cleanup, performance boosts, and enhanced cybersecurity into a single, easy-to-use application. It removes junk files, optimizes settings, and alerts for threats-all in one app.

With SwiftEdge, your PC stays fast, clean, and secure without the hassle of juggling multiple programs. Whether youâ€™re a student, professional, or casual user, SwiftEdge ensures your device runs at peak performance while keeping your data safe.

Project Description
-------------------

SwiftEdge will be an amazing free way to get rid of those unnecesary temp files the unused applications you downloded
years ago. Edge will check your applications versions and make sure they are vulnerability free and make sure


Proposed Implementation Language(s)
