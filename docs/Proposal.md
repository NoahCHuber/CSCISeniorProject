Problem Statement
-----------------

Slow computer performance and security threats are common frustrations for users. Cluttered files, outdated applications, and inadequate system protection often lead to sluggish systems and increased vulnerability. While cleaning up your system and keeping software updated can help, managing multiple tools for performance optimization and security is a hassle. 

Most users rely on separate antivirus programs and performance boosters, but these often conflict, drain system resources, or leave gaps in overall security. This inefficiency leads to wasted time, reduced productivity, and increased vulnerability to cyberattacks, which cost individuals and businesses millions every year. 

SwiftEdge Security & Optimizer solves this by combining system cleanup, performance boosts, and enhanced cybersecurity into a single, easy-to-use application. It removes junk files, optimizes settings, and alerts for threats-all in one app.

With SwiftEdge, your PC stays fast, clean, and secure without the hassle of juggling multiple programs. Whether you’re a student, professional, or casual user, SwiftEdge ensures your device runs at peak performance while keeping your data safe.

Project Description
-------------------

SwiftEdge Security & Optimizer is a lightweight software application designed to enhance computer performance and security in a single, streamlined solution. The project aims to eliminate the need for multiple optimization and security tools by integrating system cleanup, performance tuning, and enhanced cybersecurity into one intuitive platform.

The application offers features such as junk file removal, system optimization, high-risk software version numbers, and real-time security checking. By leveraging automation and smart search algorithms, SwiftEdge enhances device speed, prevents slowdowns, and safeguards against cyber threats without requiring constant user intervention.

SwiftEdge is developed for a wide range of users, from students and professionals to everyday PC users, ensuring their devices remain efficient, responsive, and secure. The project’s goal is to provide a user-friendly, all-in-one solution that optimizes performance while maintaining lightweight cybersecurity measures, making digital experiences smoother and safer for everyone.

Proposed Implementation Language(s) 
-----------------------------------

 - Python 
 - C++ 
 - Powershell 


Libraries, Packages, Development Kit(s)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

While we may not use third-party libraries directly, we will be using programs like RavenDevTeam/TALON to see the implementation of Python scripts in Powershell to run commands to alter system settings. \
We will also be using Hellzerg/Optimizer as a reference to a similar optimizer but with different outcomes. \
The UI and software version number functionality would like to be similar to Norton 360. \
Any supporting libraries, packages, or other development kits will be listed here at a later date. 

Additional Software/Equipment Needed
------------------------------------

Hardware: 
 - Windows PC 11 
 - Amd64 (Not Arm64 or aarch) 

Software: 
 - VSCode 
 - Terminal/Powershell 

Personal Motivation
-------------------

We aspire for a faster, more efficient, and secure Windows experience through an innovative standalone application with a simple, elegant, and easy-to-use, interface. \
We strive to develop an application that can have real-world applications for both personal use when setting up a Windows machine for the first time or commercial use for helping small businesses with their technology. This application would allow us to help small businesses and give them a generic but secure way to make their computers faster, more efficient, and more secure in just a few clicks. This not only makes the business owner happy but also makes us happy seeing small businesses succeed. 

Outline of Future Research Efforts
----------------------------------

(PLEASE! Keep in mind that this is a very generic outline for future research efforts that will be subject to change)
To complete this project successfully, several research areas need to be explored:

## Performance Optimization Techniques:
 - Investigate efficient algorithms for junk file removal and system optimization. 
 - Look into utilizing Python as a script to run junk file removal and other system optimizations. 
 - Evaluate memory management strategies to ensure minimal resource consumption. 
 - Deeply evaluate which services can be disabled in Windows that will not affect system stability. 

## Cybersecurity Enhancements:
 - Research methods for detecting version numbers, very generic vulnerabilities, and possibly malware. 
 - Identify best practices for integrating security updates without system slowdowns. 
 - Research is Python scripts that can be used to initialize an application updater without user interaction.

## User Experience and Interface Design:
 - Study user preferences for an intuitive, minimalistic interface. 
 - Interfaces that may be easy to construct, simple, and elegant. 
 - Test different UI/UX frameworks for ease of navigation and accessibility. 
 - Research open-source methods for developing our very own interface specific to our application.

## Software Integration and Compatibility:
 - Ensure seamless compatibility with Windows systems (specifically Windows 11), including different application versions. 
 - Research potential conflicts with existing antivirus and optimization software (including Windows Defender workarounds). 
 - Look into future possibilities of software conflicts and application updater conflicts (including Microsoft Store). 
 - Other generic software integration and compatibility for cybersecurity software. (Possibly look for open-source cyber software).

## Automation Implementation:
 - Explore ways to implement automated performance tuning. One click that's it mentality. 
 - Research open-source methods of automating software version checking and updating similar to Norton 360. 
 - More automation methods here using Python scripts.

## Scalability and Future Development:
 - Develop a roadmap for expanding features in future iterations. (Post basic functionality). 
 - Possibly research to develop a website for background and details on software functionality with a download link online. 
 - Research automation methods if deploying from a USB stick. (Not best security practice as malware can hop through USB).

## By focusing on these research areas, SwiftEdge Security & Optimizer can achieve its goal of providing a robust, efficient, and user-friendly solution for PC performance and security.
