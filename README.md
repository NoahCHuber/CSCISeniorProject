# SwiftEdge Security & Optimizer

## Brief Project Description

SwiftEdge Security & Optimizer is a lightweight software application designed to enhance computer performance and security in a single, streamlined solution. The project aims to eliminate the need for multiple optimization and security tools by integrating system cleanup, performance tuning, and enhanced cybersecurity into one intuitive platform.

The application offers features such as junk file removal, system optimization, high-risk software version numbers, and real-time security checking. By leveraging automation and smart search algorithms, SwiftEdge enhances device speed, prevents slowdowns, and safeguards against cyber threats without requiring constant user intervention.

## Compile/Deploy

Application will be developed to run in either an exe format or a python script executable. 
Code written will be pre-compiled and no tweaking needs to be performed unless the application is running incorrectly.
Application will either be run as an administrator in exe format or run through the terminal ./script.py
