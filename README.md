# SwiftEdge Security & Optimizer

## Brief Project Description

SwiftEdge Security & Optimizer is a lightweight software application designed to enhance computer performance and security in a single, streamlined solution. The project aims to eliminate the need for multiple optimization and security tools by integrating system cleanup, performance tuning, and enhanced cybersecurity into one intuitive platform.

The application offers features such as junk file removal, system optimization, high-risk software version numbers, and real-time security checking. By leveraging automation and smart search algorithms, SwiftEdge enhances device speed, prevents slowdowns, and safeguards against cyber threats without requiring constant user intervention.

## Compile/Deploy

This application is developed using PowerShell scripts and will be compiled into a single executable using PS2EXE. 
This application must be run using administrator privileges when opening the .exe. A Windows Form should open and the user can select the options they would like before running the script for each section. The GUI is modular and each section will have its own interface and button to execute the script. To learn more details please see the user interface section in the requirements document. 

## Usage

System Clean Up (Unused System Files) \
Performance Optimizations (Changes Registry for performance booster) \ 
Security Check and Hardening (Checks for Generic Vulnerabilities and Optional System Hardening) \
Software Version Checker (Checks Software Version Numbers for Vulnerabilities using external NVD CVE)
